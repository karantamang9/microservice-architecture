### AWS Microservice architecture for hyper-local grocery delivery company :

-   Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters — for running scalable microservices.
-   Amazon Aurora — a data store to leverage the benefits of serverless architectures and multiple replications.
-   Mongo DB — so the open-source NoSQL database can run on EC2 clusters.
-   Redis — the database cache layer.
-   RabbitMQ — the messaging layer running on auto-scaling EC2 clusters.
-   Apache Solr — the open-source search tool running on auto-scaling EC2 clusters.
-   Apache Zookeeper — for configuration management on EC2 clusters.
-   Amazon API Gateway, AWS Shield, and AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) — for end-point security.
-   Amazon CloudFront — for a global content delivery network.
-   AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) — for granular access controls.
-   AWS Secrets Manager — to store encryption keys.
-   Amazon CloudWatch — for the management and governance layer, as well as for monitoring and auditing.
-   Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) — to store container images.
